# Wiki rules

- `.agentplane/context/agentplane.context.yaml` is the machine-readable context contract.
- This file is the human-readable wiki policy referenced by that manifest.
- `context/wiki/AGENTS.md` is agent-facing local guidance; keep it aligned with this policy, not broader than it.

## Format

- Wiki pages live under `context/wiki/**` and use AgentPlane frontmatter.
- Each page frontmatter must include a stable `canonical_id`, `title`, `modality`, `epistemic_status`, `visibility`, `source_refs`, `claims`, `graph_refs`, `conflicts`, and `updated_by`.
- Each generated page should also include Obsidian properties `aliases`, `tags`, and
  `cssclasses` for better vault navigation and display.
- Use the modalities listed in `.agentplane/context/agentplane.context.yaml`.
- Cite source-backed prose with numeric notes such as `[1]`, then keep raw-data Markdown links in
  a trailing `## Sources` section.
- Use Obsidian-compatible wikilinks whose target case exactly matches a canonical page path, title,
  or alias. Prefer `[[canonical-page|Display Label]]` or
  `[[canonical-page#Stable Heading|Display Label]]` when display wording differs.
- Keep normal Markdown links for source refs, external URLs, file paths, and line-addressed provenance.

## Language

- Write synthesized wiki prose in English by default.
- Source titles, direct quotes, proper names, glossary aliases, file paths, and code identifiers may keep their source language.
- When a non-English source term is important, keep it as an alias or quoted evidence detail and use the canonical English term in synthesized prose when identity is clear.
- If a page intentionally uses a different prose language, state the reason in the page body or frontmatter and treat it as a local exception.

## Topology

- Choose the smallest source-backed wiki hierarchy that fits the project.
- Do not force a universal `concepts/`, `entities/`, `decisions/`, `modules/`, `contradictions/`, and `reports/` layout unless the source analysis justifies it.
- Prefer updating existing canonical pages over creating duplicates.
- Create new pages only when the topic is reusable for future tasks or useful to a human reader.
- Use stable headings inside broader pages for small objects that do not deserve standalone pages.
- Record topology decisions before creating new page families when the source shape is ambiguous or broad.

## Provenance

- Keep raw sources in `context/raw/**`; preserve the user-created hierarchy when citing raw sources.
- Keep durable machine artifacts under `.agentplane/context/derived/**`.
- Keep service caches under `.agentplane/context/service/**`.
- Do not manually edit `.agentplane/context/derived/**`; rebuild projections through context commands.
- Every factual claim, decision, risk, workflow, and definition needs source refs or an explicit no-source reason.
- Preserve conflicts and open questions instead of flattening contradictory sources into one unsourced claim.
- Do not copy secrets or non-publishable source spans into public wiki pages.

## Maintenance

- Run `agentplane context wiki lint <path>` after creating or materially changing wiki pages.
- Run `agentplane context wiki index context/wiki` after adding, moving, or materially renaming wiki pages.
- Run `agentplane context verify-task <task-id>` before closing task-bound context work.
